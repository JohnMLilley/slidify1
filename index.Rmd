## BMI plot

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
wt_v <- c(110:240)
ht_v <- c(48:84)

bmi_df <- data.frame(matrix(0,nrow=length(wt_v), ncol=length(ht_v)))
                     
colnames(bmi_df) <- ht_v
rownames(bmi_df) <- wt_v

for(r in 1:length(wt_v))
{for(c in 1:length(ht_v))
 {  bmi_df[r,c] <- (wt_v[r]/ht_v[c]^2)*703;  }
}

bmi_mat <- data.matrix(bmi_df, rownames.force = NA)

image.plot(1:ncol(bmi_mat), 1:nrow(bmi_mat), t(bmi_mat), col = terrain.colors(80), 
      axes = FALSE, xlab = "Height Inches >", ylab = "Weight lbs >", main = "BMI v Heigh & Weight")
axis(1, 1:ncol(bmi_mat), colnames(bmi_mat))
axis(2, 1:nrow(bmi_mat), rownames(bmi_mat))

```
